# DPT9-kmeans
DPT907-Project

This project is a 9th semester(3. semester on master) project on University of Aalborg
We have in this project used code from previous projects, 
as well code from other souces which we have rewrote for our purposes.

Our kmeans has been based on http://www.dataminingresearch.com/index.php/2010/06/gmeans-clustering-software-compatible-with-gcc-4/
which we have taken a large amount of our code from. We have however converted it for our purposes and rewritten small portions.

The purposes for this project are:
To have 3-5 different libraries/languages which all do the euclidean Kmeans.
In the end we compare how easy they were to write in and how many lines of code they each used, 
apart from that we look breifly on performance.
